Running the Frontend in Docker Compose

An experimental build is available as “tasks-fe-docker.zip” in the files section.

This frontend is designed to be run with Docker Compose.

Please note that this will be a separate Docker Compose environment than the one used to run the database.

To run in docker:

Ensure docker is running

Run docker-compose up from the project directory

This will build the frontend docker image. To rebuild run:

docker-compose down
docker-compose rm
docker-compose up --build
